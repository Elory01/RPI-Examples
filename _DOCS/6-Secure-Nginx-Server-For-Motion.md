# Installation Of SECURE Nginx Server For Motion On Raspberry Pi

![IoT JumpWay Docs](../images/main/Raspberry-Pi-Documentation.png)

## Introduction

The following information will help you install a secure Nginx server for your Motion stream on your Raspberry Pi.

## Hardware Requirements

1. Raspberry Pi

## Before You Begin

Before you begin you should follow the tutorials below as this tutorial is for securing the Linux Motion stream, you should follow the [Installing Linux Motion On Your Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-RPI-Examples/blob/master/_DOCS/4-Securing-Your-Raspberry-Pi-With-IPTables.md "Installing Linux Motion On Your Raspberry Pi") tutorial first. This tutorial will not work without following the [Setup Domain Name & SSL For Your Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-RPI-Examples/blob/master/_DOCS/3-Raspberry-Pi-Domain-And-SSL.md "Setup Domain Name & SSL For Your Raspberry Pi") tutorial.

## Guide

1. Update your packages and install Nginx:

    ```
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade
        $ sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

2. Start Nginx and check it is working by visting the IP address of your Raspberry Pi:

    ```
        $ sudo service nginx start
    ```

3. Execute the followin commands, this will take some time so kick back with a beer.

    ```
        $ cd /etc/nginx
        $ sudo openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048
    ```

4. After following the [Setup Domain Name & SSL For Your Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-RPI-Examples/blob/master/_DOCS/3-Raspberry-Pi-Domain-And-SSL.md "Setup Domain Name & SSL For Your Raspberry Pi") tutorial, place your ca.crt, crt.crt and key.key files into the /etc/nginx folder.

5. Execute the following to open up the configuration file:

    ```
        $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```

6. Replace its contents with the following:

    ```
        server {
        listen 80;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
        server {
            listen 443 ssl;
            server_name YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME;

            add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;
            ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
            ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS;
            ssl_buffer_size 8k;
            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
            ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:30m;
            ssl_session_timeout 30m;

            ssl_certificate          /etc/nginx/crt.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key      /etc/nginx/key.key;

            ssl_stapling on;
            resolver 8.8.8.8;
            ssl_stapling_verify on;

            ssl_dhparam  /etc/nginx/dh2048.pem;
            ssl_trusted_certificate  /etc/nginx/ca.crt;

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://YOUR_RPI_IP:YOUR_MOTION_STREAM_PORT;
            }

        }
    ```

7. Replace the following in the above script:

    ```
        YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME -> Your SSL secured domain name
        YOUR_RPI_IP -> Your Raspberry Pi IP address
        YOUR_MOTION_STREAM_PORT -> The port on your Raspberry Pi that you set Motion to stream to
    ```

8. Reload / Restart Nginx:

    ```
        sudo service nginx reload
    ```

10. Commands to reload / start / stop the Nginx server:

    ```
        sudo service nginx start
        sudo service nginx stop
        sudo service nginx reload
    ```
