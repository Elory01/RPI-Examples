# Installation Of OpenCV 3.2.0 On Raspberry Pi

![IoT JumpWay Docs](../images/main/Raspberry-Pi-Documentation.png)

#WARNING: This issue seems to be unstable with the Raspberry Pi, please feel to try it but at this moment it seems best to stick with 3.1.0

## Introduction

The following information will help you install the latest version of OpenCV, 3.2.0, on your Raspberry Pi. This installation includes the additional modules required for facial identification.

## Hardware Requirements

1. Raspberry Pi.
2. 16 GB Card

## Software Requirements

1. Jessie

## Guide

1. Update apt-get:

    ```
    $ sudo rpi-update
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

2. Install developer tools:

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui pkg-config
    ```

3. Install required libraries:

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install \
        libjpeg-dev \
        libtiff5-dev \
        libjasper-dev \
        libpng12-dev \
        libavcodec-dev \
        libavformat-dev \
        libswscale-dev \
        libeigen3-dev \
        libxvidcore-dev \
        libx264-dev \
        libgtk2.0-dev
    ```

4. Install libraries used to optimize OpenCV:

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
    ```

5. Install Python development libraries & Numpy:

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    ```

6. Install Numpy:

    ```
    $ pip install numpy
    $ pip3 install numpy
    ```

7. Create a directory to home OpenCV and enter it:

    ```
    $ mkdir opencv && cd opencv
    ```

8. Checkout current OpenCV 3.2.0 & the contribs:

    ```
    $ wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.2.0.zip -O opencv_source.zip
    $ wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/3.2.0.zip -O opencv_contrib.zip
    ```

9. Unzip the code:

    ```
    $ unzip opencv_source.zip
    $ unzip opencv_contrib.zip
    ```

10. Move into the 3.2.0 directory, make the build dir and move into it:

    ```
    $ cd ~/opencv/opencv-3.2.0 && mkdir build && cd build
    ```

11. Configure the build:

    ```
    $ sudo cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
        -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
        -D BUILD_WITH_DEBUG_INFO=OFF \
        -D BUILD_DOCS=OFF \
        -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
        -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
        -D BUILD_opencv_ts=OFF \
        -D BUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF \
        -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \
        -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
        -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-3.2.0/modules \
        -D ENABLE_NEON=ON \
        -D WITH_LIBV4L=ON \
            ../
    ```
12. If everything went ok you should see the following:

    ```
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    ```

13. Build OpenCV, grab a beer as this will take a while, come back and check at intervals to see if there has been any errors:

    ```
    $ sudo make -j4
    ```

14. Once complete you should see the following:

    ```
    [100%] Built target ...
    ```

15. Install OpenCV:

    ```
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
    ```

16. Test the installation:

    ```
    $ python/python3
    >> import cv2
    >> print (cv2.__version__)
    >> import face
    ```

17. If you do not see any errors here, congratulations, you have successfully installed the latest version of OpenCV on your Raspberry Pi, grab another beer to celebrate your accomplishment.
